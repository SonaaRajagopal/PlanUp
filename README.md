# PlanUp

This project aims to develop a user-friendly Task Scheduling Application. Our goal is to provide a digital platform for University Students to manage their tasks, and plan and schedule events and deadlines as a chance to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and improve time management skills. 

Alongside creating an intuitive user interface and incorporating essential features such as Eisenhower Matrix integration, task management, reminders, and progress tracking, we aim to implement various software testing techniques to ensure the application's usability, performance, reliability, security, and maintainability.
